# Yellow Moon Project

_Template made by [graphberry.com](https://www.graphberry.com/item/yellow-moon-free-psd-landing-page) and images downloaded from [gratisography.com](http://www.gratisography.com/.)._

### Coded by me as a _learn-by-doing_ study exercise.

## Things I wanted to practice with this project:

- Code a resposive website without using jQuery, flexbox or css grid;
- Icons as a font;
- PNG sprite;
